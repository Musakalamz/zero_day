Vagrant is a tool that sits on top of a VM provider. Again, we chose to use VirtualBox as a provider, but other providers exist out there and Vagrant offers the possibilty to use dfferent providers (More info here). Just like VirtualBox, we choose to use Vagrant because it is free, reliable and well maintained. Keep in mind that the purpose here is to use Virtual environments, and both VirtualBox and Vagrant are just means to achieve this purpose.

VirtualBox is a Virtual Machine provider. The virtual machines themselves will be spawned using VirtualBox. VirtualBox is free and lightweight, which make it a perfect choice for us.
